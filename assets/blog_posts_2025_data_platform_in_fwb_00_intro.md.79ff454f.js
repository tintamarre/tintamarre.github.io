The heterogeneous nature of these sources makes it challenging to ensure data access, quality, consistency ‚Äî and hence exploitation. To address this challenge, a decision made years ago, was to implement a virtualisation layer (based on <a href="https://www.denodo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Denodo</a>) on top of DBMS.</p><p>Denodo is a powerful tool for data virtualization, but it requires a certain level of expertise to configure and maintain. This can be a barrier for some teams, especially those with limited technical resources. It is also not 100% compliant with most SQL standards (Denodo VQL), which can lead to confusion and errors when working with the data (accross upstream and downstream systems).</p><blockquote><p>While data virtualisation helps to unify the data access, it also adds complexity to the architecture by providing a new layer. Moreover, it does not solve complex transformations, load processes, and data quality monitoring issues. This is where the <strong>data platform</strong> comes into play.</p></blockquote><h2 id="üèóÔ∏è-conceptual-architecture-of-a-data-stack" tabindex="-1">üèóÔ∏è Conceptual architecture of a data stack <a class="header-anchor" href="#üèóÔ∏è-conceptual-architecture-of-a-data-stack" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;üèóÔ∏è Conceptual architecture of a data stack&quot;">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Starting from <em>raw data</em> (or sometimes <em>virtualised data</em>), the Ministry need to analyse, transform and move data into a format that is suitable for exploration, analysis and/or exploitation.</p><p>A data stack is usually composed of several components that work together to manage and process data. The specific components of a data stack can vary depending on the needs of the organization, but they typically include:</p><ul><li><strong>Sources</strong>: These are the systems and applications that generate and store data. They can include databases, APIs, flat files, and other data repositories.</li><li><strong>Platform</strong>: This is where the compute is done to process and analyze data. It can include cloud-based platforms, on-premises servers, and other computing resources.</li><li><strong>Storage</strong>: This is where data is stored for later use. It can include databases, data lakes, and other storage solutions.</li><li><strong>Processing</strong>: This is where data is transformed and prepared for analysis. It can include ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, data pipelines, and other data processing tools. This also includes ML and AI processes that can be used to analyze and extract insights from data.</li><li><strong>Dashboard</strong>: This is where data is presented in a way that is easy to understand and analyze.
