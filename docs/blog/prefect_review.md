# Prefect review

## Introduction

In the world of data engineering, there are many tools that can be used to build data pipelines. One of the most popular tools is [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/). Airflow is a great tool, but it has some drawbacks. For example, it is not easy to test Airflow pipelines. Also, Airflow is not a Python native tool. This means that you have to learn a new language to use Airflow.

[Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/) is a new tool that tries to solve some of the problems that Airflow has. Prefect is a Python native tool. This means that you can use Python to build your data pipelines. Prefect also has a great UI that makes it easy to monitor your pipelines.
