# My very first Dashboard

## Introduction

From 2011 to 2014, I worked as Scientific Advisor in ICT for a Brussel Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology ([Innoviris](https://innoviris.brussels/)). 

The goal of Innoviris (also known as IRSIB) is to promote, support and valorize scientific research and technological innovation/development in the Brussels-Capital Region by providing financial support for projects presented by SMEs, large companies and finance educational institutions/research centers.
