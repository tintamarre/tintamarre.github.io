## About me

I'm a socio-technical analyst and data engineer. I am currently working at [Fédération Wallonie-Bruxelles](https://federation-wallonie-bruxelles.be). 

I like to work on data projects, especially when they involve data visualization and data analysis. I also founded some companies liked [Mesylab](https://mesylab.com), [OpenJustice](https://openjustice.be/) and [TagData]().
