I'm a socio-technical analyst and data engineer. I am currently working at [Fédération Wallonie-Bruxelles](https://federation-wallonie-bruxelles.be).

I like to work on data projects, especially when they involve data visualization, orchestration and analysis. I also founded some companies ([Mesylab](https://mesylab.com)) or non-profit like [OpenJustice](https://github.com/openjusticebe/) and _TagData_.
